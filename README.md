# The Rocket Nose Cone

This directory depicts various properties of rocket nose cones through the use of python code and jupyter notebooks.

The list of nose cone shapes and their equations were found in ['The Descriptive Geometry of Nose Cones'](http://servidor.demec.ufpr.br/CFD/bibliografia/aerodinamica/Crowell_1996.pdf) by Gary A. Crowell Sr., written in 1996. 

Using this directory:
- The [`NoseConeShapes.ipynb`](https://github.com/jacobhall03/RocketNoseCone/blob/main/NoseConeDesigns.ipynb) notebook interactively displays the shapes of rocket nose cones. Users should view this file to get an idea of what the various shapes are and their pros and cons.
- The [`lib/NoseConeShapeEquations.py`](https://github.com/jacobhall03/RocketNoseCone/blob/main/lib/NoseConeEquations.py) module is the location of the programmatic implementation of the shape equations for the nose cones.
